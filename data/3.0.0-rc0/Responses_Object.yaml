Responses Object:
  description: |
    A container for the expected responses of an operation. The container maps a HTTP response code to the expected response. It is not expected from the documentation to necessarily cover all possible HTTP response codes, since they may not be known in advance. However, it is expected from the documentation to cover a successful operation response and any known errors.

    The default MAY be used as a default response object for all HTTP codes that are not covered individually by the specification.

    The Responses Object MUST contain at least one response code, and it SHOULD be the response for a successful operation call.

        description: Wildcard are now allowed (2XX)
      description: Any HTTP status code can be used as the property name (one property per HTTP status code). Describes the expected response for that HTTP status code. Reference Object can be used to link to a response that is defined at the OpenAPI Object's responses section. This field MUST be quoted for compatibility between JSON and YAML (i.e. "200"), and MAY contain the uppercase character, X to designate a wildcard, such as 2XX to represent all response codes between [200-299].
