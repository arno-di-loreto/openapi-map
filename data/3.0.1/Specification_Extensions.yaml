Specification Extensions:
  name: ^x-
  type: Any
  patterned: true
  openapiType: true
  specificationAnchor: specificationExtensions
  description: |
    While the OpenAPI Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

    The extensions properties are implemented as patterned fields that are always prefixed by "x-", for example, x-internal-id. The value can be null, a primitive, an array or an object. Can have any valid JSON format value.

    The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).
